UI ELEMENTS:
please lets optimise the ui. i want this theme and look, very clean.

functionality i want it like Trae and like openAI, i guess. Though i want a small dashboard as well. some modules are already in the directory, but want a clock, a calendar day, weather, up next events, alarms, unread emails /sms etc. btc and eth/usd tickers.

because i'm gonna have a lot of funcrions, i want a navigation bar on left and collapsable where all functions can be accessed. Chat in a chat bubble in the bottom right corner which can open up in the bottom like openai to chat and kinda hoping the middle of the screen then becomes a workspace.

Also lets add add connect to google connected - hence email/calendars/files etc. - subtle green or red light

also want it to be a welcoming hub with a sweet message or innfo specific to me

do websearch for glas mprphism for style reference
modern, minimal and easy on the BTC_ETH_API_KEY
add dark light mode and add compatibility
